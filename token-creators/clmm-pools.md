A simpler model, *Orca's Splash Pools*, are also available for users wanting a quicker, simpler and cheaper pool requiring little management see the [How to create a Splash Pool guide](/token-creators/splash-pools).
The *Concentrated Pool Creation Tool* is intended for expert and professional users only. If you are neither of these please very carefully research this subject before using the tool, please create a ticket by accessing the [🤖│support-ticket](https://discord.gg/orca-so) channel on Discord, if you need assistance or have any questions.

NOTE: If you have not added your token to the Orca Token List (see [how to add a token to the Orca Token List](/token-creators/orca-token-list)), tickArray accounts may need separately initialising for your token to facilitate trade. This can be achieved by creating additional positions. [Orca Splash Pools](/token-creators/clmm-pools#how-to-create-a-pool-on-orca-permissionlessly) do not require tickArray management, and may be a better option for some users.

You can view the state of your pool, including its tickArrays on Account Microscope (https://everlastingsong.github.io/account-microscope/).
If additional support is required, please reach out to Orca through an open communication channel or via [#❓│dev-questions](https://discord.com/channels/798712664590254081/838660851178274866) on Discord.

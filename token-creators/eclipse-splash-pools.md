### What are Splash Pools?

*Splash Pools* are a new innovation from Orca, designed to enable users and token creators to deploy liquidity in a unique type of pool built on top of Orca's existing CLMM infrastructure.

These pools exclusively support full-range positions, eliminating the need to initialize additional *tickArray accounts*. This makes them ideal for projects that want to establish pools that operate seamlessly without requiring ongoing management.

With Splash Pools, creating pools on Orca is faster, simpler, and more cost-effective than ever. Since Splash Pools use the same program as Orca's existing pools, they are automatically compatible with all current integrations.

### How do Splash Pools differ from true CPMM pools?

In *Splash Pools*, liquidity providers (LPs) receive a pool position NFT that represents their specific position, rather than receiving fungible LP tokens. Additionally, yields earned by LPs must be manually harvested, in contrast to CPMM pools where yields are automatically compounded into the position. This operational model offers LPs greater flexibility in managing their yields but requires more hands-on involvement compared to CPMMs.

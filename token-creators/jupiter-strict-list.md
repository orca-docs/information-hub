Once you have listed your token on Orca you may want to take steps to increase exposure and improve your holder's experience.
Listing your token on CoinGecko (see [How to list a new asset with CoinGecko](/token-creators/coingecko-listing)) may help with the process.
Jupiter's documents provide details for how to get your token onto Jupiter's Strict List, which you can find here, [Getting Your Token onto Jupiter](https://station.jup.ag/docs/get-your-token-onto-jup#getting-on-the-strict-list).

The process includes opening a PR via Github (https://github.com/jup-ag/token-list), you can find sample PRs in the associated Readme here (https://github.com/jup-ag/token-list/blob/main/README.md), this process cannot be bypassed and Orca cannot expedite it on your behalf.

### Orca Treasury

The Orca Treasury includes the *Community ORCA Treasury* and the accumulating *Orca Fee Treasury*, which may be used by tokenholders to fund development grants or other initiatives that support the long-term health of the Orca protocol.. You can read the latest updates on the treasury in the [Orca Treasury Report #7](https://orca-so.medium.com/orca-treasury-report-7-24e781398dab).

Orca strives for transparency and in that spirit discloses relevant wallet addresses as follows:

  Undistributed fees are collected fees (in various forms) that are yet to be converted and distributed to the appropriate treasury.

### Climate Fund

As part of Orca’s [commitment to making a real-world impact](https://medium.com/orca-so/introducing-the-orca-impact-fund-4c26e875e9c4), a [small fee](/reference/useful-information/trading-fees) is collected from trades, which goes to the [Orca Climate Fund](https://www.orcaclimate.fund/), which in turn invests in climate tech entrepreneurs for a sustainable future.

Shortly after the launch of the ORCA token, the [first ever “proto-governance” vote](https://medium.com/orca-so/introducing-the-orca-impact-fund-4c26e875e9c4) was held to determine which of two organizations should receive the donation. The worthy recipient chosen by the Orca community was [*Ocean Conservancy*](https://oceanconservancy.org/). The first donation of $550,000 was [announced](https://medium.com/orca-so/orca-s-550k-donation-to-ocean-conservancy-fdcc674ec564) in November 2022.

Orca has worked closely with Ocean Conservancy to determine which of their current initiatives will benefit the most from the additional funds.

To support a smooth donation process, funds were converted to USDC in advance of the donation. As you can imagine, communicating with potential recipients can be challenging when the proposed value of the donation is constantly fluctuating! Going forward, tokens allocated to the Climate Fund will be converted to stables on a quarterly basis.

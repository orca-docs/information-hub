### What is Orca

[Orca](https://www.orca.so) is the most trusted DEX on Solana and Eclipse, built by DeFi OGs for the best trading and LPing experience.
Orca is a unique protocol centered around a Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker (CLMM) with powerful features that allow users to access constant-product-like functionalities. Orca focuses on creating the most user-friendly environment for traders and LPs of varying experience levels, as well as for ecosystem builders

### Mission

Orca exists to change the way assets are traded, and we are going to effect that change through catalyzing a paradigm shift in how market participants provide liquidity.

We strive to make trading more efficient and transparent, expand the scope of what can be traded, and connect people across the globe to coordinate capital in new ways. This vision requires going beyond becoming the dominant liquidity layer for today’s Solana-native assets; it means onboarding much of the legacy financial system as well. This necessitates transforming what that system looks like, not just transposing it on-chain.

Orca’s ethos is based on 3 Ps: professional, principled and playful.

* **Professional**: Orca develops DeFi products and features with a user-first approach, ensuring user-friendliness and convenience for a diverse range of users, regardless of their experience level.
* **Principled**: The DeFi space is often plagued by empty promises and malicious tactics. Therefore, Orca's highest priorities are the safety of user funds, and the transparency of our processes. Orca values steady development and honest communication over catchy slogans and questionable tactics. This commitment has enabled Orca to stand the test of time, maintaining zero hacks over the past four years.
* **Playful**: Community lies at the heart of Orca's activities, and we believe that DeFi can be fun. Therefore, Orca innovates with the visual aspects of the brand and platform, while also offering engaging activities for the community.

### History

Orca started from humble beginnings: just two builders hacking at a desk in Tokyo, with no venture funding or famous backers. Since 2021, Orca has grown to become one of the top DEXs in Solana ecosystem and in crypto in general.

Orca launched its original Constant Product AMM (CPMM) pools while Solana was still in its infancy, becoming one of the first protocols in the ecosystem. The entire initial supply of the ORCA token was airdropped to users based on their liquidity provider and trader activity.

In March 2022, Orca transitioned to a more advanced liquidity mechanism with the launch of the Whirlpool program, which still underpins Orca’s CLMM to this day. This marked a departure from the constant product market maker (CPMM) model. With Whirlpools, liquidity providers were able to concentrate their liquidity within specific price ranges, optimizing capital efficiency and earning potentially higher yields. The concentrated liquidity model delivered a better trading experience by providing traders with more favorable rates and less price impact, particularly for larger trades.
In October 2024, Orca launched on Eclipse, a modular blockchain that operates as a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum while deploying the Solana Virtual Machine for execution.

### Orca v2 UI Launch and User Groups

After multiple product iterations, Orca launched its v2 UI in 2024, catering to four user groups:

* **Traders:** can swap tokens cheaply, quickly, and confidently on Orca. Price accuracy is ensured by the built-in Jupiter price comparison tool, while low slippage is guaranteed by the capital efficiency of Orca's CLMM pools.
* **Liquidity Providers:** sophisticated and novice liquidity providers can benefit from Orca's powerful position creation sidebar and new portfolio feature to quickly create and manage full range and concentrated liquidity positions.
* **Token Creators:** creators of new tokens can create permissionless pools for their token launches on Orca using nearly any SPL token on Solana.
* **Builders:** fellow ecosystem builders can tap into the most efficient source of liquidity on Solana, build quickly and easily using Orca's double-audited, open-source smart contract and SDK, and join the growing number of projects integrating with Orca.

Today, Orca is structured as a DAO with powers delegated to a DAO Council, established and elected through an ORCA holder vote. Holders of the ORCA token [can engage in governance](/staking/governance) by formulating, discussing, and refining proposals (see Governance), and help chart Orca DAO's course through the DeFi seas.

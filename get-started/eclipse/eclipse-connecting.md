It is straightforward to connect to Orca on Eclipse, but before you can use Orca on Eclipse you will need to install a compatible wallet and bridge some ETH to Eclipse, see our guide [here](/get-started/eclipse/eclipse-bridging-eth).
If you are a Solana user and will be bridging assets from Solana you may prefer to use the same address on both chains, to do so you will need a wallet that is compatible with both Solana and Eclipse, such as BackPack.
If you do not already have Backpack installed you can install it for your device [here](https://backpack.app/download). If you already use a different Solana wallet app you can use your seed phrase to import your existing address to Backpack, you can do that by following an appropriate guide from [here](https://support.backpack.exchange/all-articles?cat=Wallet+Import%2FRecover).
Once you have installed a compatible wallet and bridged some assets you are ready to use Orca on Eclipse.

Before you can use Orca on Eclipse you will need to install a compatible wallet and bridge some ETH to Eclipse. For the purpose of this guide we will use Backpack wallet.
If you do not already have Backpack installed you can install it for your device [here](https://backpack.app/download). If you already use a different Solana wallet app you can use your seed phrase to import your existing address to Backpack, you can do that by following an appropriate guide from [here](https://support.backpack.exchange/all-articles?cat=Wallet+Import%2FRecover).

Before we can do anything on Eclipse we will need some ETH to use as gas, this will mean bridging some ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to your Eclipse address, or if you are a Solana user using Eclipse's Gas Station service.

### Onboarding to Eclipse from Ethereum.

if you do not already hold some ETH on Ethereum mainnet there are several ways you can get some:

* Purchase some ETH on a CEX and transfer it to your Ethereum Mainnet wallet.
* Bridge some wrapped ETH from Solana to Ethereum Mainnet using a bridge such as Portal, deBridge. or a bridge/cross chain trade tool built into a wallet app.
* Bridge some ETH from an Ethereum L2 to Ethereum Mainnet.

Once you hold some ETH on Ethereum Mainnet you can bridge it to Eclipse to use as gas, this can be achieved easily using the [Eclipse Canonical Bridge](https://app.eclipse.xyz/bridge), you can find our guide [here](/get-started/eclipse/eclipse-bridging-eth).

### Onboarding to Eclipse as a Solana user.

If you are coming to Eclipse from Solana and do not hold any ETH on Ethereum Mainnet, or simply want to cut out some steps, you can use [Eclipse's Canonical Gas Station](https://app.eclipse.xyz/gas-station), to convert some SOL to ETH. You can find a guide here.
If you need any support or have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to open a support ticket from the Orca UI by clicking `Support` in the wallet menu. You can also reach the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/orca-so) or [Telegram](https://t.me/orca_so).

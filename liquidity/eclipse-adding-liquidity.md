Due to [divergence loss](https://pintail.medium.com/uniswap-a-good-deal-for-liquidity-providers-104c0b6816f2), you are not guaranteed a positive return!

* Navigate to https://www.orca.so/portfolio
* Click on the ellipsis button (`...`) to the right of your position.
* Select `+ Deposit Liquidity`.

* The Portfolio Management Sidebar will open with the Deposit tab selected. You can add liquidity in two ways:
   Enter the number of tokens or the dollar value you wish to deposit in one of the fields.

   Or, by clicking on one of the `Max` buttons.

   The deposit values will automatically adjust to match the required ratio for your position.
* (Optional) Activate the `Autoswap` toggle to automatically trade between the paired tokens to match your desired deposit value.
* (Optional) adjust your liquidity slippage by clicking on the `Liq. slippage` button - see [Understanding Slippage](/reference/educational-documents/understanding-slippage).
* Once you are satisfied with your deposit values, click `Deposit`.

* Deposit Complete! 🎉 As you have added liquidity to your existing position, you will not receive a new *pool position NFT*. Your existing NFT will continue to represent your amended position and will already be in your wallet. It will be displayed as a simple image with the warning "**DO NOT BURN**".

   
**DO NOT** sell or burn this NFT. You can send it to another wallet to transfer your position, but (whale forbid) please **DO NOT** burn or sell it, or you'll lose your liquidity!
Orca **CANNOT** help you recover any funds lost as a result of burning a pool position NFT.

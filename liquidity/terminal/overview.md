When you first open the [Pools Page](https://www.orca.so/pools), you’ll land on the **Pool Explorer**. To view the Liquidity Terminal for a specific pool, click on that pool in the explorer.

Once opened, the **Liquidity Terminal** displays the price chart alongside a range of liquidity management tools.

The layout of the Terminal will vary depending on whether your wallet is connected. Once connected, you’ll see the following key areas:

### Price Chart

Displays aggregated price history for the selected asset pair. The chart is packed with tools for analysis and positioning.
→ See the [Price Chart Navigation Guide](/liquidity/advanced/charts) for a detailed walkthrough.

   In each case the number of tokens to be withdrawn will automatically adjust to match the required ratio for your position.
* (Optional) adjust your liquidity slippage by clicking on the `Liq. slippage` button - see [Understanding Slippage](/reference/educational-documents/understanding-slippage).
* Once you selected an amount to withdraw the `Withdraw` button will become active.

* If you enter values that result in all of your liquidity being removed, or you select `Max` in a token field instead of seeing the `Withdraw` button you will see a `Close Position` button.

A central feature of the Liquidity Terminal is the integrated price charts.

**This chart displays the combined price trend for this token pair across the entire ecosystem.**
*Individual pool prices, including Orca’s, may vary due to localized liquidity and trading activity.*

### Price Chart Overview

While the Liquidity Terminal’s price chart includes a range of advanced features, its core layout is straightforward. The *horizontal axis* represents time. The *vertical axis* represents price. At a glance, the chart lets you track how price has moved over time.

Beyond that, the chart includes tools for drawing, analysis, and customization—supporting more informed liquidity provision strategies.

When `Custom` is selected in the *Create Position* sidebar, you’ll also be able to adjust your selected price range directly on the chart.
→ See the [Create a Custom Range how-to guide](/liquidity/getting-started/custom-range) for a step-by-step walkthrough,

The controls for the price chart interface is divided into two main toolbars and two axis control panels:

* Top toolbar overview

The top toolbar lets you configure how the price chart looks and behaves. This section moves left to right across the toolbar and outlines the key controls.

#### Time Interval

Select the time interval for each candlestick. Options range from minutes to days. For example, selecting a 15-minute interval means each candlestick represents 15 minutes of price activity.

#### Indicators

Add technical indicators to support your analysis. These tools highlight trends or patterns based on price movements or volume. Selected indicators will appear directly in the chart pane.

#### Chart Settings

Customize your chart’s appearance and behavior. Click the `Settings` icon in the top right corner, or double-click a candlestick to open the configuration panel. You can adjust visual styles, scale options, and other display settings.

#### Fullscreen Mode

Switch to fullscreen for a focused chart view. This hides surrounding panels, allowing you to analyze the chart without distractions. The fullscreen toggle is located next to the `Settings` icon.

* **Left toolbar overview**

The left toolbar provides access to drawing tools used for annotating and analyzing the chart. These tools help you mark up the chart, highlight patterns, or record reference points for future decisions.

You can:

* Add trend lines, shapes, and markers
* Annotate price levels and ranges

* Measure movements and forecast potential scenarios
* Leave comments or notes directly on the chart

These tools are useful for planning positions, tracking historical behavior, or simply keeping visual records of your strategies.

* Right **control panel overview**

You can scale the vertical axis manually by clicking and dragging. Hover over the axis to reveal additional options: select `A` to enable Auto mode (which fits all visible data to the screen), or `L` to switch to a logarithmic scale.

* Bottom panel: x-axis controls and further settings

You can scale the x-axis manually by clicking and dragging. To access additional options, click the `Settings` icon at the right end of the axis. This opens the price scale settings, where you can choose the scale mode, configure label visibility, and adjust other display preferences.

Each section is designed to provide quick access to essential tools without cluttering your workspace. You can interact with these elements directly or use keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation. Shortcuts are visible when you hover over components or open the relevant menus.

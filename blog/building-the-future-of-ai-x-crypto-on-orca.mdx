In the past year, we’ve seen a remarkable surge in AI adoption across the crypto space. From smart contract automation to sophisticated on-chain trading strategies, AI is changing the way we interact with decentralized finance (DeFi). At Orca, we’re excited to be part of this transformation by providing a robust platform for AI-driven applications on Solana.

Today, we’re thrilled to introduce how Orca’s AI integrations are powering new possibilities — and how developers like you can get started.

We’ve recently collaborated with three AI agent frameworks — **Solana Agent Kit**, **GOAT by Crossmint**, and **Eliza by AI16z** — to help you build next-generation on-chain agents.

### Why AI x Crypto?

In traditional finance, AI has long been used to optimize trading, manage risk, and streamline operations. Now, with the advent of decentralized protocols, we can pair these same AI techniques with the transparency, security, and global accessibility of crypto. This means:

* **Smarter Trading Strategies** — AI can continuously monitor market conditions to optimize liquidity positions or identify arbitrage opportunities.
* **Full Autonomy** — Agents can execute trades, mint tokens, or even create entire DeFi strategies without human intervention.
* **Expanding Developer Toolkits** — New frameworks are making it easier than ever for developers to deploy on-chain AI agents that interact with DeFi protocols.

At Orca, we see tremendous potential for AI to empower builders and users alike. Whether you’re a professional trader, a DeFi enthusiast, or a curious developer, these integrations open up novel ways to leverage Orca’s features.

### 1. Solana Agent Kit


Solana Agent Kit is an open-source toolkit designed to help AI agents seamlessly interact with the Solana blockchain. With a single integration, agents (using any model) can autonomously perform over 15 Solana Actions — everything from trading and launching tokens to lending, airdropping, and deploying on AMMs.

**Key Features of the Integration**

* **Create & Mint Tokens**: Agents can autonomously create and mint new tokens.
* **Launch Liquidity Pools on Orca**: Deploy liquidity pools and provide liquidity in one transaction.
* **Single-Sided Liquidity**: Agents can initialize Whirlpools on Orca with just one token, eliminating the need for a second asset.

> *Single-sided liquidity pools allow liquidity providers to supply just one token of a pair, reducing the complexity of managing two separate assets. They open up new strategies for LPs and can help mitigate the risk of impermanent loss.*

### 2. Eliza by AI16z


Eliza is an AI agent framework from ai16z that integrates conversational AI with on-chain execution. Think of it as a chat-based interface that can manage real DeFi operations under the hood.

**Key Features of the Integration**  
With our Eliza integration, agents can actively monitor and reposition your Orca LPs, reacting to real-time market conditions. You can stay informed through the chat terminal by requesting updates and insights on your positions. These insights can guide you toward refining your approach, and when you’re ready, you can simply restart Eliza with your revised strategy — helping you maintain an informed and responsive investment strategy.

### 3. GOAT by Crossmint


GOAT (Great Onchain Agent Toolkit) by Crossmint is an open-source library for on-chain AI agent actions. It’s compatible with top AI frameworks like LangChain, Vercel’s AI SDK, and Eliza, and it supports both TypeScript and Python. Importantly, GOAT spans 30+ blockchains, including Solana — making it a versatile toolkit for multi-chain developers.

**Key Features of the Integration**

* **Pool Creation**: Automate the creation of new pools on Orca.
* **Single-Sided Positions**: Open single-sided LP positions for flexible liquidity provision.
* **Position Management**: Easily open, close, or fetch all your positions, including those that are out of range.

### What’s Next for Orca?

We believe this is just the beginning of the AI-driven DeFi revolution. Over the coming months, you can expect:

* **Enhanced Developer Tooling**: More robust APIs and documentation to simplify on-chain interactions.
* **Extended AI Partnerships**: Collaboration with additional agent frameworks and projects in the AI x crypto ecosystem.
* **Advanced Trading Features**: New ways to automate and optimize liquidity provisioning on Orca.

Our goal is to empower both developers and end-users to innovate on Solana. With Orca’s integrations, you can build AI agents that trade autonomously, launch tokens with a single command, and maintain LP positions in real-time.

April has been a month of significant developments across multiple fronts — from governance implementation to UX refinements and developer tools. We’re excited to share the latest developments that continue to move Orca and Solana DeFi forward.

### Protocol Upgrade

The Orca community passed a [major governance proposal](https://app.realms.today/dao/66Du7mXgS2KMQBUk6m9h3TszMjqZqdWhsG3Duuf69VNW/proposal/Y5pg61GRuYN66GfvdpNdUX8z9rPNNne6Rhy5GXKTyrt) aimed at realigning the protocol’s incentives, supporting long-term growth, and enhancing value for the Orca community.

Since the approval**,** we’ve burned 25 million ORCA tokens reducing the total supply by 25%.

The systematic ORCA buyback mechanism is also now live. As outlined in the proposal, 20% of all protocol fees generated from Whirlpools are being used to purchase ORCA on the open market. These purchased tokens are being deposited into the designated xORCA reserve wallet.

Development of the xORCA staking contract is progressing. Once deployed, the ORCA tokens accumulated through the buyback program will be used to seed the initial staking rewards for xORCA holders.

### Liquidity Terminal Refinements

Our Liquidity Terminal continues to evolve into a command center for LPs on Solana.

**Persistent Settings**: The terminal now remembers your last settings between sessions, allowing you to pick up exactly where you left off.

**Resizable Position Table**: Customize your viewing experience with a draggable position table.

**Advanced Charting**: Added time interval options on price charts for more granular market analysis.

### Simplified Launchpad Integration

Integrating the Orca Whirlpools Program into developers’ own on-chain Anchor Programs used to be a longer process. Now, that’s changed.

We’ve released a fully documented [**CPI Integration Repo**](https://github.com/orca-so/whirlpools-cpi-examples) to make integrating with Orca Whirlpools simple. Launchpads and builders can now graduate tokens to Orca liquidity pools more seamlessly.

What’s included in the repository:

* Anchor program examples (v0.29.0, v0.30.1, v0.31.0)
* Client-side code for both @solana/web3.js and @solana/kit
* Testing suites with LiteSVM + Bankrun
* Full support for Splash Pools and liquidity locking

If you’re building a launchpad and want to graduate tokens into Orca Pools, this is your path forward.

### Full Token Extensions Support

Solana’s Token Extension standards are powerful. Orca now offers comprehensive support for Token Extensions across the entire platform.

**Transfer Fee Awareness**: All core operations (trading, harvesting, liquidity operations, and autoswap) now properly detect and account for tokens with transfer fees.

**Transparent Fee Disclosure**: We’ve added dedicated line items in trading and liquidity dialogs that clearly distinguish between network fees and transfer fees, ensuring users understand exactly where every basis point goes.

**Contextual Information**: Strategic callouts have been added to create position, trade, and position details interfaces to help users understand interest-bearing token fees before they confirm transactions.

### Advancing DeFi Regulation: Orca, Solana Policy Institute, and Superstate Submit a SEC Proposal

We have joined [Solana Policy Institute](https://www.solanapolicyinstitute.org/) and [Superstate](https://superstate.com/) to submit a proposal to the SEC to develop regulatory frameworks to enable the compliant issuance, trading, and settlement of securities on public blockchains.

“Project Open is a step towards empowering innovation in financial markets through the use of blockchain-native technologies like tokenization and AMMs (Automated Market Makers),” says **Nathan Davis, CEO of Orca.**

“These technologies can support novel modes of capital formation while simultaneously advancing the SEC’s other core objectives of investor protection and maintenance of fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Orca is excited to work alongside Superstate and the Solana Policy Institute to bring these innovations to market in a thoughtful, responsible way.”

For a deeper dive on the proposal submitted to the SEC, find the filing [here](https://www.sec.gov/files/ctf-written-project-open-wireframe-04282025.pdf).

### Looking Forward

As we continue to level up, we remain focused on making DeFi more accessible, efficient, and rewarding for the Orca community. The journey continues, and we’re excited to have you with us every step of the way.

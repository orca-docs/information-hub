Orca is happy to announce the launch of the new [**Token Creation Tool**](https://www.orca.so/create-token) for both Solana and Eclipse mainnet. The launch meets Orca’s vision to make DeFi more accessible and the tool aim to empower users with the ability to create tokens effortlessly.

Whether you’re a new project on Solana or Eclipse, community, this tool eliminates the complexities of token creation, making it as easy as a few clicks. This tool ensures that:

* **Accessibility**: No coding skills are required.
* **Customization**: Users can define token properties, including name, symbol, and supply
* **Security**: Mint authority and metadata mutability are protected.

*All tokens created using Orca’s Token Creation tool use TokenExtensions (Token-2022).*

### Step-by-Step Guide to Token Creation

The tool is easy-to-use and below is a step-by-step guide to guide in creating your token using Orca’s new tool:

### 1. Access the Tool

* Visit the [Create Tokens](https://www.orca.so/create-token) page.
* Connect your wallet on either Solana or Eclipse mainnet.

### 2. Fill in Token Details

* **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your token (e.g., “Orca”)
* **Symbol**: Choose a unique symbol (e.g., “ORCA”)
* **Description (Optional)**: Provide a brief description for reference (e.g., “Orca is the most user-friendly DEX on Solana”)
* Select a randomized token address.

### 3. Upload a Token Image

* Drag and drop or upload an image to visually represent your token
* Supported file types : SVG, JPG, JPEG, PNG
* Recommended size: 256x256 pixels

### 4. Define Token Supply

* Enter the total supply (e.g., 100,000,000) or select a common supply template:
* **100 Million** (e.g., ORCA, PENG)
* **1 Billion** (e.g., $WIF, JTO)
* **10 Billion** (e.g., PYTH, BLZE)

### 5. Decimals

* Decimals are pre-configured based on the token supply
* For example, the default is 9 decimals.

### 6. Security Settings

* The tool ensures mint authority, freeze authority, and metadata mutability cannot be modified post-creation for enhanced security

### 7. Preview Your Token

Before finalizing, you’ll see a preview of the token you’re about to create. This screen will display all the details, including:

* Token Name
* Symbol
* Description
* Total Supply
* Decimals
* Network Fee

Ensure everything is accurate before proceeding. If changes are needed, you can go back and edit.


### 8. Confirm and Create Your Token

Once satisfied, click **“Create Token”** to finalize the process.

Approve the transactions in your wallet, and the token will be deployed to the network!


### What Happens After Token Creation?

### Congratulations! Your Token Is Live

Once the token is created, you’ll be greeted with a success screen confirming that your token has been deployed. The screen includes:

* Token Name
* Token Address (with an option to copy or view it on a block explorer)
* A direct link to start creating a pool for your token.

### Next Steps: Create a Liquidity Pool

After creating your token, the next logical step is to add liquidity and list it for trading on Orca or other decentralized exchanges.

Click **“Create Pool”** to start this process.

### FAQs

### What are the fees for token creation?

* Transaction fees are minimal and depend on the network’s gas fees.

### Can I edit the token after creation?

* No, mint authority and metadata mutability are locked for security purposes.

### Is this tool available for other networks?

* Currently, the tool supports Solana and Eclipse mainnet

By democratizing token creation, Orca continues to lead the way in DeFi accessibility. Dive in and bring your token vision to life today! 🐳

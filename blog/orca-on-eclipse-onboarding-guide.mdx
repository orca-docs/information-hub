As the one of the **leading DEXs on Solana**, Orca is thrilled to be have gone live on **Eclipse mainnet** earlier this month. Eclipse represents the cutting edge of modular blockchains, offering unparalleled speed, scalability, and a seamless experience for users.

Whether you’re a seasoned DeFi expert or new to the ecosystem, this onboarding guide will help you maximize the benefits of this exciting evolution.

This quick guide will walk you through setting up a compatible wallet, bridging assets, and starting your journey using Orca on Eclipse.


### 1. Set Up a Compatible Wallet

For the best experience, we recommend using the [Backpack wallet](https://backpack.app), which is compatible with both Solana and Eclipse.

* **New Users:** Install Backpack for your device [here](https://backpack.app).
* **Existing Solana Users:** Import your Solana address to Backpack using your seed phrase. Follow the [step-by-step guide](https://support.backpack.exchange/all-articles?cat=Wallet+Import%2FRecover) if needed.

You can find more details about other compatible wallets [here](https://docs.eclipse.xyz/developers/wallet/mainnet-wallets).

### 2. Bridge Assets to Eclipse

Before using Orca, you’ll need some ETH for gas fees on Eclipse. Follow the instructions below based on your starting point:

**From Ethereum Mainnet:**

* Purchase ETH on a centralized exchange (CEX) and transfer it to your wallet.
* Use a bridge like [**Eclipse Canonical Bridge**](https://app.eclipse.xyz/bridge) to move ETH to Eclipse. Learn more about the Eclipse Canonical Bridge [here](https://docs.eclipse.xyz/developers/bridges/eclipse-canonical-bridge).


**From Solana:**

* Use the [**Eclipse Gas Station**](https://app.eclipse.xyz/gas-station) to convert SOL to ETH for gas. This eliminates the need to interact with Ethereum mainnet.
* Check out the Gas Station guide [here](/get-started/eclipse/eclipse-getting-eth-for-gas)

**Periods of high market volatility have long introduced challenges across DeFi.**

For liquidity providers (LPs), sharp price swings increase exposure and risk — often without proportional rewards. Meanwhile, token creators launching new assets face the challenge of maintaining liquidity during volatile price discovery phases, often resorting to expensive, unsustainable incentive programs.

To realign these market dynamics, Orca is introducing **Adaptive Fees**. This new feature automatically increases fee percentages during periods of high volatility, creating a natural counterbalance to market turbulence and a more efficient ecosystem for our users.

During high volatility, LPs face the greatest risk of impermanent loss, yet traditionally earn the same fees as during stable conditions. By automatically increasing compensation during these high-risk periods, Adaptive Fees create proper risk-reward balance, ensuring LPs are incentivized to maintain liquidity precisely when the market needs it most.

For token creators, particularly those launching new projects, Adaptive Fees transform one of their biggest challenges into an advantage. New tokens naturally experience significant price volatility during their price discovery phase, which has traditionally made it difficult to attract and retain liquidity. With Adaptive Fees, this volatility becomes a feature rather than a bug, as the higher fees during these periods make their pools more attractive to LPs, helping maintain critical liquidity depth when it is most meaningful.

Embrace the volatility of the market with us as we walk through how to identify pools with Adaptive Fees, and how the Adaptive Fee bonus is calculated for Orca pools.

At Orca, we’re committed to creating the definitive on-chain liquidity experience. March was a landmark month at Orca. We launched several major features that address user feedback and move us closer to our vision of building the next NASDAQ.

**Liquidity Terminal (Phases 1 & 2)**

Our most significant launch this month has been the first two phases of the Liquidity Terminal.

Phase 1 introduced professional-grade visualization tools for LPs:

* Real-time price charts
* Position ranges of your portfolio
* Card View of your portfolio to see all details in one view

Phase 2 transformed this into a more comprehensive command center where users can:

* View and modify positions within the same screen
* Access a complete position table for any selected pool
* Create new positions without navigating away
* Access the terminal directly from their portfolio.

Phase 3 is coming soon.

This holistic approach eliminates the fragmented workflows that have plagued liquidity providers since DeFi’s inception. What once required multiple page navigations and context switching, now happens in a single and intuitive interface.

**Liquidity Locking**

In March, we transformed how new token projects establish credibility with the launch of our Liquidity Locking tool. Unlike traditional methods that requires projects to burn their position NFTs (permanently destroying them) or send LP tokens to inaccessible addresses, our innovation allows creators to lock liquidity while still harvesting fees and rewards.

Liquidity Locking on Orca aligns the incentives of project teams and traders by creating permanent liquidity guarantees while enabling sustainable funding for legitimate projects. With transparent verification through integration with DexScreener and early adoption by projects like GoFundMeme, this feature is already enhancing trust and stability across the Solana token landscape.

**Short-Term Yield Insights**

Understanding potential returns is critical for capital allocation. Our new Estimated Yield feature now supports additional timeframes (15min, 30min, 1hr, 4hr, and 8hr) giving LPs more visibility into short-term yield patterns. This granular data allows for more strategic position management, especially during volatile market conditions when capital efficiency matters most.

**Enhanced Portfolio Experience**

Our new Position Range feature provides percentage-based indicators showing how far positions are from their boundaries, with clear min/max price displays and color-coded indicators for instant assessment.

For mobile users managing multiple positions, we’ve implemented card views that make scrolling and monitoring intuitive on smaller screens.

**Developer Tooling Improvements**

The Orca team has also developed the transaction sender library available for both [Rust](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orca-so/tx-sender) and [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orca-so/tx-sender) developers. This library streamlines transaction handling on Solana with built-in support for priority fees and Jito MEV tips. It enables more efficient execution in congested network conditions. The transaction sender library also features automatic compute unit budget estimation, which eliminates the need for manual calculations that often lead to transaction failures. Compatible with any Solana project, this tooling makes integration with Orca’s liquidity layer more accessible and reliable for developers across the ecosystem.

We are only a quarter of the way through our ambitious 2025 roadmap. In April, we’ll be expanding on these foundations with additional tools that further streamline liquidity management and bring newer, better opportunities for LPs. Thank you for being part of Orca’s journey. We look forward to sharing more innovations with you in the weeks ahead.

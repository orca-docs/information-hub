Find answers to frequently asked questions about xORCA staking and governance.

#### What is xORCA?

xORCA is a liquid staking token you get when you stake ORCA. It accrues protocol incentives as fees are used to buy back ORCA and grow the xORCA↔ORCA exchange rate.

#### How do I earn yield?

As protocol fees buy back ORCA and deposit into the pool, each xORCA becomes backed by more ORCA. This means the exchange rate may adjust upward over time. Rewards are not guaranteed and may vary based on protocol activity and governance decisions.

#### Is xORCA an LST (Liquid Staking Token)?

Essentially, yes. While LST in the Solana ecosystem usually describes derivatives of staked SOL just like those LSTs, xORCA is composable and can be used in DeFi just like any other token.

#### Why is APY shown in ORCA terms?

We display estimated reward rates in ORCA to factor out USD price swings. The USD value of rewards still changes with the market price of ORCA.

#### Can I use xORCA in DeFi?

Yes! xORCA is an SPL token—you can hold, transfer, or use it in DeFi protocols (e.g., LP, lending) while it continues earning yield.

#### Can I transfer or use xORCA in DeFi during cooldown?

No. Claim Tickets cannot be transferred. xORCA can be transferred when held.

#### Are my tokens safe?

The staking contract is open-source, fully-audited by Sec3, and upgradeable only by a 3-of-5 multisig (same as Whirlpool).

#### What risks should I know about?

* ORCA price volatility → USD value may go down.
* Smart contract risk (like any DeFi protocol).

* Liquidity risk if DeFi integrations are limited early on.

#### Is there slashing?

No. Yield is from buybacks, not validator performance.

#### What happens if buybacks stop?

Exchange Rate growth would halt. Your claim remains pro-rata on vault ORCA.

#### Can xORCA holders vote on governance proposals?

Both ORCA and xORCA holders will be able to participate in governance. Details [here](/governance/xorca).

Orca is governed by its community through a decentralized governance system. Token holders can propose changes, vote on decisions, and shape the future of the protocol.

## How Governance Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Community Proposals">
    Any ORCA token holder can submit proposals for protocol changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discussion Period">
    Proposals are discussed openly before voting begins
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voting">
    Token holders vote using their ORCA (or xORCA) tokens
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution">
    Approved proposals are implemented by the team or DAO Council
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Hold ORCA Tokens" icon="wallet">
    You need ORCA tokens to participate in governance:
    - [Swap for ORCA](https://www.orca.so) on the Orca platform
    - Purchase on supported exchanges
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Stake for xORCA (Recommended)" icon="lock">
    Staking your ORCA for xORCA gives you:
    - **Boosted voting power** — xORCA carries more weight than unstaked ORCA
    - **Staking rewards** — Earn additional ORCA over time
    - **Protocol alignment** — Demonstrate long-term commitment

Adding your token to the Orca Token List improves discoverability and user experience. Tokens on the list display with proper names, symbols, and logos throughout the Orca interface.

## Why Add Your Token?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Better UX** | Your token shows with name and logo instead of just an address |
| **Discoverability** | Users can find your token by searching its name or symbol |
| **Trust signals** | Listed tokens appear more established to users |
| **Trading volume** | Easier discovery often leads to more trading activity |

## Requirements

Before submitting your token for listing, ensure you meet these requirements:

### Mandatory Requirements

- **Active liquidity pool** - Your token must have an existing pool on Orca

Token Extensions enable advanced functionality for tokens with compliance requirements. Learn which extensions Orca supports.

### Token Extensions Overview

Token Extensions are advanced functionality designed specifically to meet the need of businesses with compliance obligations. They are added feature sets designed with regulatory obligation in mind, and may break Whirlpool’s functionality if integrated incorrectly.

Orca currently supports a set of Token Extension, with some requiring Token Badge permission. The extensions support status is listed on the table below.

Token Badge is only granted via an explicit, case by case review by the Orca Team. Due to some extension’s ability to compromise Orca’s programs, Token Badges are not issued lightly.

If your project has a reasonable requirement for using Token Extensions, you may reach out to Orca. Please fill out the contact form linked at the bottom of the page.
